          - paragraph [ref=e35]: shadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.
        - generic [ref=e36]:
          - paragraph [ref=e37]:
            - strong [ref=e38]: This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.
          - paragraph [ref=e39]: "You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app."
          - paragraph [ref=e40]:
            - text: This approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn’t included in the library.
            - strong [ref=e41]: Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.
          - paragraph [ref=e42]: "This is what shadcn/ui aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:"

              - strong [ref=e45]: "Open Code:"
              - text: The top layer of your component code is open for modification.
            - listitem [ref=e46]:
              - strong [ref=e47]: "Composition:"
              - text: Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.
            - listitem [ref=e48]:
              - strong [ref=e49]: "Distribution:"
              - text: A flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.
            - listitem [ref=e50]:
              - strong [ref=e51]: "Beautiful Defaults:"
              - text: Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.
            - listitem [ref=e52]:
              - strong [ref=e53]: "AI-Ready:"
              - text: Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.
          - heading "Open Code" [level=2] [ref=e54]
          - paragraph [ref=e55]: "shadcn/ui hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:"
          - list [ref=e56]:
            - listitem [ref=e57]:
              - strong [ref=e58]: "Full Transparency:"
              - text: You see exactly how each component is built.
            - listitem [ref=e59]:
              - strong [ref=e60]: "Easy Customization:"
              - text: Modify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.
            - listitem [ref=e61]:
              - strong [ref=e62]: "AI Integration:"
              - text: Access to the code makes it straightforward for LLMs to read, understand, and even improve your components.
          - paragraph [ref=e63]:
            - emphasis [ref=e64]: In a typical library, if you need to change a button’s behavior, you have to override styles or wrap the component. With shadcn/ui, you simply edit the button code directly.

          - heading "Composition" [level=2] [ref=e70]
          - paragraph [ref=e71]:
            - text: Every component in shadcn/ui shares a common, composable interface.
            - strong [ref=e72]: If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.
          - paragraph [ref=e73]:
            - emphasis [ref=e74]: A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones.
          - heading "Distribution" [level=2] [ref=e75]
          - paragraph [ref=e76]: shadcn/ui is also a code distribution system. It defines a schema for components and a CLI to distribute them.

            - listitem [ref=e78]:
              - strong [ref=e79]: "Schema:"
              - text: A flat-file structure that defines the components, their dependencies, and properties.
            - listitem [ref=e80]:
              - strong [ref=e81]: "CLI:"
              - text: A command-line tool to distribute and install components across projects with cross-framework support.
          - paragraph [ref=e82]:
            - emphasis [ref=e83]: You can use the schema to distribute your components to other projects or have AI generate completely new components based on existing schema.
          - heading "Beautiful Defaults" [level=2] [ref=e84]
          - paragraph [ref=e85]: "shadcn/ui comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:"

              - strong [ref=e88]: "Good Out-of-the-Box:"
              - text: Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.
            - listitem [ref=e89]:
              - strong [ref=e90]: "Unified Design:"
              - text: Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.
            - listitem [ref=e91]:
              - strong [ref=e92]: "Easily Customizable:"
              - text: If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.
          - heading "AI-Ready" [level=2] [ref=e93]
          - paragraph [ref=e94]: The design of shadcn/ui makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.
          - paragraph [ref=e95]:
            - emphasis [ref=e96]: An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design.
